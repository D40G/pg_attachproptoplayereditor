# pg_attachproptoplayereditor
Makes attaching props to the player ped easy to use and FREE!

# How to use
To use this all you have to do is <sub>/ptpeditor <boneID> <Model></sub> and then follow the on screen instructions.

# Why command base?
This is due to the fact I originally made this to position props on player peds for my server but decided to publish this to the world. 

# Future updates?
In the future, I am planning on adding a menu along with the ability to play animations through this script to make it even easier to use!
